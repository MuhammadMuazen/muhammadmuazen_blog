<h2 id="what-do-i-classify-as-knowledge">What do I classify as knowledge?</h2>
<p>Well, we may differ here in defining knowledge or information—so you might disagree with some of what I say, and that’s fine. Disagreement, after all, is also part of knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout my learning journey, I’ve categorized the knowledge I seek to acquire into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>General knowledge.</li>
<li>Professional knowledge.</li>
<li>Abstract knowledge.</li>
<li>Intellectual and spiritual knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I delve into explaining each of these, I find myself compelled to clarify something first.</p>
<p>At first glance, the categories above may seem neatly divided—but they’re segmented by how knowledge is acquired, not by any fundamental difference in their nature. In reality, these domains of knowledge overlap blatantly and influence one another profoundly, whether directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>For example, I classify psychology and sociology as belonging to intellectual, spiritual, abstract, and general knowledge. Similarly, computer science for me falls under both professional and abstract knowledge.</p>
<p>Exceptions exist for every rule—this is undeniable. But when discussing knowledge, pinning down examples, ideas, or disciplines becomes exceedingly difficult due to the vast expanse of science and human understanding. Delving into granular details would transform this article into volumes.</p>
<h2 id="general-knowledge">General Knowledge</h2>
<h4 id="what-is-general-knowledge">What is General Knowledge?</h4>
<p>General knowledge is the basic understanding needed to navigate everyday life. It encompasses all fields of knowledge at a superficial level—from knowing how to change a car tire or choosing the right tools to fry an egg, to grasping broader, harder-to-control concepts like forming a general impression of the local security situation or the current political climate of the world.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-general-knowledge-acquired">How is General Knowledge Acquired?</h4>
<p>The necessity of consuming certain information varies from person to person, depending on their daily life, challenges, and experiences. That said, age does not necessarily equate to greater general knowledge. Instead, it’s directly tied to how a person actively absorbs this knowledge. This is why, at times, a younger individual may surpass an older one in understanding the nuances of daily life.</p>
<p>To get the best results when acquiring general knowledge, I follow these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>References Don’t Matter: You consume general knowledge for yourself, not to rescue others. Memorization is easier when you focus on the information itself—not its source. Citations and attributions are irrelevant unless you’re in academia.</li>
<li>Note-Taking Is Optional (With One Exception): Writing things down is unnecessary—unless the knowledge is complex, multi-step, and location-dependent. Example: Steps to buy and register a car may be online, but keeping a personal checklist (with locally specific details) can help. Online guides often miss nuances that only experience reveals.</li>
<li>The Internet Is a Fast, but Flawed, Friend: It’s the quickest way to answer questions—but never assume it’s infallible. Cross-check critical information.</li>
<li>News Outlets Are Always Biased: Following a single news source won’t give you an accurate picture of security, politics, or even general conditions in your area. Solution? Track multiple perspectives—even those you disagree with—to approximate objectivity.</li>
<li>Experience Is the Best Teacher (But Location Matters): Real-world testing beats theory, but outcomes vary by place and time. Mentally (or physically) tag knowledge with contextual notes (where/when it applied).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="professional-knowledge">Professional Knowledge</h2>
<h4 id="what-is-professional-knowledge">What is Professional Knowledge?</h4>
<p>Professional knowledge refers to the expertise directly tied to one’s daily work—whether in accounting, engineering, software development, trade, or any other income-generating field. It’s the specialized know-how that enables you to perform your job effectively.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-acquire-professional-knowledge">How to Acquire Professional Knowledge?</h4>
<p>The main challenge with this type of knowledge is that it varies significantly from one field to another. However, since I work primarily as a cybersecurity engineer, I’ll outline the steps I follow that I believe can be applied, directly or indirectly, to many other fields, given that engineering itself is a broad discipline.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the knowledge acquisition process in the professional field: To get an accurate view of a specific branch of knowledge, always prefer looking at practical references, books, and official documentation.</li>
<li>Solving simple problems: The internet is the ideal solution, but in this case it&rsquo;s preferable to gain even a basic understanding of the solution before implementing it. This enables the mind to provide more dynamic formulations that align with similar problems.</li>
<li>AI tools: We must talk about artificial intelligence agents - an option that should be viewed as nothing more than a search engine. When using it, if you encounter an unknown word or term, it&rsquo;s preferable to research it yourself for the same reason as the previous point.</li>
<li>Documentation&hellip; Documentation: Documentation is your weapon! There are hundreds of problems a person faces in their professional field - it&rsquo;s impossible to memorize them all. Personally I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for documentation due to the nature of my work, but usually pen and paper also work in many cases.</li>
<li>Continuous follow-up: Constant follow-up of the latest news in your professional field via the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-knowledge">Abstract Knowledge</h2>
<h4 id="what-is-logical-knowledge">What is Logical Knowledge?</h4>
<p>I call it the knowledge that stimulates the abstract side of the brain, such as solving mathematical or physics problems. It doesn’t necessarily have to be in the form of a test; it can happen spontaneously. Instead of solving a math problem, one could read its solution directly—but to stimulate the brain further, it’s always preferable to set a logical challenge. Personally, I use programming problems—not necessarily to solve in one day—but to keep the brain engaged in the realm of logical abstract thinking.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-acquire-logical-knowledge">How to Acquire Logical Knowledge?</h4>
<p>The core issue with this type of knowledge is that it’s fundamentally tied to passion. Some people can’t stand hearing the word &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo; or a complex numerical problem. However, logical stimulation in such cases doesn’t have to come from these sciences alone but through other means, such as writing techniques, grammar, and language—all of which fall under the umbrella of logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a specific logical problem to solve within a defined timeframe (1-3 days). If you give up, you can review the solution directly while ensuring you understand it.</li>
<li>Follow content that stimulates the brain, such as YouTube channels discussing mathematical or literary problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intellectual-and-spiritual-knowledge">Intellectual and Spiritual Knowledge</h2>
<h4 id="what-is-intellectual-and-spiritual-knowledge">What is Intellectual and Spiritual Knowledge?</h4>
<p>it is the knowledge used to evaluate right from wrong in our daily lives, explore the depths of our spiritual selves, and understand the philosophy of ethics and religion.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-acquire-intellectual-and-spiritual-knowledge">How to Acquire Intellectual and Spiritual Knowledge?</h4>
<p>This type of knowledge faces the most formidable challenge: the influence of social conditioning on its acquisition. Developing intellectual or spiritual dimensions that diverge from the societal framework one was raised in typically constitutes a radical evolution—one immediately confronted by both mind and heart.</p>
<p>While I’m not here to delve into how societal shaping affects the human psyche’s pursuit of knowledge, I mention this point because it inevitably influences, one way or another, the methods of acquiring such knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Present any idea in discrete, neutral, and independent points - then mentally evaluate it.</li>
<li>Seek both dissenting opinions (with reasons) and agreeing opinions (with reasons).</li>
<li>Gather as many diverse perspectives as possible from different environments.</li>
<li>When reading about a specific psychological or intellectual issue, never limit yourself to one book or one author - you must examine multiple viewpoints.</li>
<li>Debate isn&rsquo;t always harmful - sometimes it&rsquo;s the only way to reach truth. Here you must balance between acquiring knowledge and citing references to advance the debate, without obsessively memorizing everything or making &ldquo;proving I am right and others wrong&rdquo; the focus of your life.</li>
<li>Self-criticism and self-doubt are part of human nature - but don&rsquo;t overindulge in them as they can have destructive effects.</li>
<li>Experiment - or as they say, &ldquo;Fu*k around and find out.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>My categorization of knowledge types in this article may not be exhaustive—but from a broader perspective, I can confidently say that any reader will find at least one category (or part of one) that aligns with their own mental framework.</p>
<p>To conclude: Everything I’ve mentioned is entirely rooted in my personal experiences. It’s perfectly natural if these ideas don’t fully resonate with you. Yet, they might serve as a solid starting point for you to define your own taxonomy of knowledge.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
