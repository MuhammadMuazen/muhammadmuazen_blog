## Passion

I’m the kind of person who gets frustrated when I solve a problem on the first try—I crave new challenges 🚩, whether in computer science 🖥️, cybersecurity 🌐, or beyond 💫. Merely knowing the answer isn’t enough; I need to understand its origin, mechanics ⚙️, and why it’s correct (and why my wrong answers failed—or if they were secretly right). This obsession with dissecting details drew me to cybersecurity: a field that’s relentless, ever-changing, and never easy. But my curiosity 🧐 doesn’t stop there—I pursue other passions 🔥 rigorously, all sharpening my core skills and expanding how I think 💡:

1. Low Level Programming 🔩: From coding in C and reading assembly to understanding operating systems components and the HAL of multiple MCUs.
2. Embedded Systems 📟: FPGAs (Xilins, Altera), MCUs (Arduios, Raspberry PIs, ESPs, STMs, ATmegas) you name it.
3. Mathematics 🔢 & Physics ⚛: I like to stimulate my brain with math & physics lectures, videos and sometimes problem solving in my free time.
6. Technology 💻: Obsessed with technology’s relentless evolution—constantly dissecting new tools, trends, and devices. 🚀 Staying ahead isn’t a habit; it’s an addiction.
7. Psychology 🧠🫀: Why? Where? When? Who? What? How? Which? All answers in any context for these questions have one thing in common... Human psychology.
8. Books 📚: I read all sorts of books from literally children books to the most complicated science books. (No I don't get everything about them but if I got just a single information from a single page I would be more than satisfied)
